# Social links profile

This project is a simple Social links profile built using plain HTML and CSS.
The goal was to create a clean, responsive layout for displaying a Social links
profile with minimal styling.

## Why Plain HTML & CSS?

For a small project like this, using React or any other JavaScript framework
would be overkill. HTML and CSS are sufficient to achieve the desired result,
ensuring fast load times and simplicity without unnecessary complexity.
